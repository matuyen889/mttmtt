Included files:
 - privacy.html         -> Privacy Policy ready to publish
 - terms.html           -> Terms of Service ready to publish
 - mttmtt-demo.html     -> Desktop-style demo UI to open and record (Electron-like)
 - voiceover.txt        -> Full male voiceover script for AI TTS (paste into ElevenLabs, etc.)
 - storyboard.txt       -> Step-by-step recording storyboard
 - README.txt           -> This file

How to produce the final verification video (recommended quick steps):
 1. Open mttmtt-demo.html in Chrome (use F11 fullscreen) and prepare to record.
 2. Use OBS Studio or Loom to record screen at 1920x1080, 30fps.
 3. Use ElevenLabs / Play.ht / Google TTS to generate the male voiceover audio from voiceover.txt.
 4. In OBS, record the screen while reading or play the generated audio in the background and do the actions; OR record clean screen and later combine screen + audio in a video editor.
 5. Export MP4 (H.264) and upload to YouTube as Unlisted for Google verification.

If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-import audio file using an online TTS provider — but I cannot call external APIs from this environment. Use the voiceover text with ElevenLabs or similar to create the audio file.
